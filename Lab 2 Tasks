1)	Find if the number is multiple of 5.

INPUT number
IF number MOD 5 = 0 THEN
    OUTPUT "The number is a multiple of 5."
ELSE
    OUTPUT "The number is not a multiple of 5."
END IF

2)	Check if a character is uppercase or lowercase.

INPUT character
IF character >= 'A' AND character <= 'Z' THEN
    OUTPUT "Character is uppercase."
ELSE IF character >= 'a' AND character <= 'z' THEN
    OUTPUT "Character is lowercase."
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Character is not a letter."
END IF

3)	Create a small calculator which only does ‘+’ or ‘*‘Operations. (Hint: Take three variable inputs with one being used for the operator)

INPUT number1
INPUT number2
INPUT operator
IF operator = "+" THEN
    result = number1 + number2
ELSE IF operator = "*" THEN
    result = number1 * number2
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Invalid operator."
    STOP
END IF
OUTPUT result

4)	Check whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.

INPUT number
IF number > 0 THEN
    OUTPUT "The number is positive."
ELSE IF number < 0 THEN
    OUTPUT "The number is negative."
ELSE
    OUTPUT "The number is zero."
END IF

5)	Determine if a person is a teenager (between 13 and 19 years old).

INPUT age
IF age >= 13 AND age <= 19 THEN
    OUTPUT "Person is a teenager."
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Person is not a teenager."
END IF

6)	Implement an algorithm to determine if a given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, except if it is also divisible by 400.
INPUT year
IF year MOD 400 = 0 THEN
    OUTPUT year + " is a leap year."
ELSE IF year MOD 100 = 0 THEN
    OUTPUT year + " is not a leap year."
ELSE IF year MOD 4 = 0 THEN
    OUTPUT year + " is a leap year."
ELSE
    OUTPUT year + " is not a leap year."

7)	Implement an algorithm to count the number of occurrences of each character in a given string.
INPUT string
FOR i FROM 0 TO 255
    character_count[i] = 0
END FOR

FOR i FROM 0 TO LENGTH OF string - 1
    character = string[i]
    index = ASCII value of character
    character_count[index] = character_count[index] + 1
END FOR
FOR i FROM 0 TO 255
    IF character_count[i] > 0 THEN
        OUTPUT CHARACTER WITH ASCII value i + ": " + character_count[i]
    END IF
END FOR
8)	Write an algorithm to calculate x raised to the power y (i.e., x y ) without using built-in power functions.

INPUT x, y
result = 1
FOR i FROM 1 TO y
    result = result * x
END FOR
OUTPUT result

9)	Calculate the area of a circle given its radius r.

INPUT r
pi = 3.14159
area = pi * r * r
OUTPUT area

10)	Find the median of three given numbers.

INPUT a, b, c
IF a > b THEN
    SWAP a AND b
END IF
IF a > c THEN
    SWAP a AND c
END IF

IF b > c THEN
    SWAP b AND c
END IF
median = b
OUTPUT median
